# Apartment-system

## As part of an Advanced Programming course in C (1st year) we were given a task to teach us different elements:

- Pointers and dynamic assignments.
- Linked lists.
- Multi-file programs.
- Text and binary files.

## Our project:

Final goal - The program manages a stock of apartments for sale.

The system will provide a wide range of functions to the user such as:
- Insert a new apartment to the stock.
- Delete an apartment from the stock.
- Show details of apartments by filter×¥
- Show history of actions on the system.

The system writes the apartments details into a binary file and a text file.
When uploading the system it reads the details from the files.
